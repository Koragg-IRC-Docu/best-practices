# best-practices
A collection of best practices for IRC client and server implementations

### Purpose

This is a set of informal guidelines meant to improve user experience; rather
than change things on a protocol level, IRC could become more adaptable as long
as the user convenience between clients and servers is consistent.

The guidelines listed within these pages are not meant to be official in any
sense, but are intended to make the user experience better and more consistent.
Additionally, the guidelines are typically implementation-dependent and should
not change the protocol in any way.
