# Images Guidelines

Images are a central part of communication. Whether it's showing someone an
infographic, sharing pictures of cats, or otherwise, the ability for users to
conveniently share and view images is considered a central part of the
experience for most chat protocols.

IRC by default does not have builtin image sharing. Instead, many people upload
to sites such as Imgur and paste links into chat. Clients that have the
capability to do so, might then display the image on-hover or below the link.

Clients that offer such functionality to automatically display images should
additionally offer the ability to turn off that functionality, either on a
global level or on a per-channel basis.
